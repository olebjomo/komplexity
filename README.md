# Komplexity — Landing Page

Files added:

- `index.html` — landing page markup
- `styles.css` — styles for the top bar, hero and layout

Preview (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# From the project folder run:
Start-Process 'index.html'
```

Notes:

- The company title uses the Google Font `Syncopate`. I assumed the requested `Scyncopate` was a small typo; if you meant a different font, tell me and I'll update.
- Change the `mailto:` address in `index.html` to a real contact address before publishing.
